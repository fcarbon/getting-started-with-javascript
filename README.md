# Getting Started with JavaScript for Web Development

This is the code repository for the course: [Getting Started w/ JavaScript for Web Development]()

This is a [Better Dev](https://better.dev) course by [Chris Sev](https://twitter.com/chris__sev)

## The Tools We'll Use

- We'll be using VS Code (view my course on [VS Code](https://productivevscode.com))
- Chrome (or a web browser like Firefox)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Starting HTML File

We'll be doing all our work inside of an `index.html` file. All our HTML, CSS, and JS will go here:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Getting Started with JavaScript</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <style>
    body, .jumbotron { padding: 30px; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>


  <!-- start javascript -->
  <script>

  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Styling with Bootstrap

We will be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to quickly get CSS styles. I'm a big fan of [Tailwind](https://beginnertailwind.com) for styling but styling isn't our focus in this course.

To quickly add the Bootstrap library, we have added the following to the <head> of our document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```
